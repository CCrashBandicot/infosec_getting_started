# Bug Bounty Hunting
Bug bounties are programs that are run by various companies to allow people to report security issues about their products in a safe and accepted manner. Many bug bounty programs offer points-based rewards that track your progress on a global leader board, but some also offer monitary or sway-based rewards as well.

Feedback and other resource recommendations are welcomed and appreciated!
